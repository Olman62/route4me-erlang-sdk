The project is a code base, and has no external dependencies.
You can place source files from the code base of the library 
to your Erlang project and use further according to examples 
found in er4cli_tests.erl

The library itself needs 3 files: 
  er4cli.erl - api calls/wrappers
  er4cli.hrl - defines
  json2.erl  - 3rd party json library

Source file er4cli_tests.erl contains samples

After inserting source codes into your project you should add
to your Erlang/OTP application dependency from inets and ssl
application. The following can be an example of your app file:

  {application, YOUR_APP,
   [{description, "..."},
    {vsn, "1"},
    {registered, []},
    {applications, [kernel, stdlib, sasl, inets, ssl]},
    {mod, {YOUR_APP_MODULE, []}},
    {env, []},
    {modules,[YOUR_MODULE_LIST]}
   ]}.
